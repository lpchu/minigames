# minigames

Minigames built in *Python2* for assignments of the "An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python" 
(Coursera) by Rice University: https://www.coursera.org/learn/interactive-python-1/
1. Stopwatch
2. Pong
3. Memory
4. Blackjack
5. Spaceship 

Initially designed (and HIGHLY recommended) to run on web-browsers (preferably Chrome) @ http://www.codeskulptor.org/

Although the scripts can also be run offline using an equivalent module SimpleGUICS2Pygame (developed by Olivier Pirson), the timer in the offline mode is not working properly at all!
